# Earthquake data visualization

The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. 

In this project you can see the result of visiting the USGS GeoJSON FeedLinks to an external site, import and visualization of the data.

Using Leaflet a map is created that plots earthquakes based on longitude and latitude from San Diego, CA.

The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color.
